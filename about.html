<p>Hi, my name is Laura Darlak. I am a former gerontology nerd turned self-taught Front End Developer. I enjoy building websites for social and ecological entrepreneurs. Currently, I am enrolled in the Flatiron School Full Stack Web Development program. My off-line interests include raising chickens, mycology, and simple living.</p>
